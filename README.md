# OpenSimPanel
WIP: External instrument panels for X-Plane

OpenSimPanel will be a Python interface using Kivy. It will provide functional aircraft gauges and instruments to be display on a light computer or RasberryPi. It is aimed to be connected to the same network the main X-plane computer is running.

OpenSimPanel is an open source alternative to the wonderfull SimVimPanel made by Vlad and Roman from http://www.simvim.com.
